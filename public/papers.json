    "abstract": "This study aims at investigating the adaptation of the loan words in Turkish and their relation to vowel harmony. I specifically focus on the loan words with final and initial consonant clusters within the framework of Government Phonology proposed in Kaye, Lowenstamm & Vergnaud (1990). Following Charette (1991, 2004), I propose that the loan words with initial (s(ı)por ‘sport’) and final (fik(i)r ‘idea’) clusters are not allowed in Turkish; thus, these words have a lexically empty position between the consonants of the clusters when adapted to Turkish. This implies that there is no consonant insertion or deletion for the adaptation of the loan words. The empty nucleus position is realized if it fails to be p-licensed (phonological licensing). I focus on why and how the empty position is realized. My claim is that the word final empty nucleus position cannot properly govern the empty position of the previous nucleus given that p-licensing fails (Kaye, 1990). Hence, the vowel has to be realized via U and I harmony in the light of licensing constraints given in Charette & Göksel (1994). The realization of the empty nucleus position in the adapted words with initial clusters follows some patterns other than vowel harmony and licensing constraints. The present study suggests that there is no epenthesis phenomenon in loan words with consonant clusters, but the issue is related to the realization of the empty nucleus which depends on the p-licensing phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel account of non-identical pronoun doubling in Dutch long-distance A-bar dependencies – specifically wh-questions and restrictive relative clauses – that features the pronoun wat in the higher clause and the pronoun wie or die in the lower clause. Assuming that A-bar pronouns have internal structure, I argue that such non-identical doubling is the result of subextraction of part of the pronoun, namely the operator in its specifier position. This operator is subextracted from the A-bar pronoun in the lower SpecCP and spelled out in its final landing site, the higher SpecCP. The subextracted operator is spelled out as wat by default – wat being the most underspecified A-bar pronoun in Dutch. The A-bar pronoun that is left behind by subextraction is spelled out as well (as wie or die), for reasons of recoverability and in order to overcome an otherwise illicit step in the derivation: rescue by PF spell out",

Based on a comparison between Italian and German, we arrive at certain similarities that suggest an underlying, uniform syntactic structure. Three differences between the languages under investigation, such as the obligation effect, word order, and case marking are used to adjust the general structure in certain ways. Ultimately, word order and case differences are shown to be reducible to one particular structural difference, i.e. the embedding of a VoiceP/ApplP by the causative predicate.",

Te-clauses, as often noted, can function as either adverbials or clausal conjuncts. We first show that while a te-clause without an overt subject may adjoin to the root syntactic tree, a te-clause that contains a lexical subject cannot, but can only be coordinated with the root syntactic tree. Then we argue that this correlation between the presence/absence of a lexical nominative subject in te-clauses and the interpretative (in)variability of them follows straightforwardly from Chomsky’s (2000) C-T dependency, put together with a fact about te-clauses that we independently establish, i.e. that, whether finite or nonfinite, they are always TPs.",

With the aim of shedding some light on the type/nature of identity effects in inflectional paradigms, the paper explores the phonological representations and properties found in the leveled paradigm. Additionally, it reviews some of the shortcomings of models that place most of the burden of explanation for analogical changes on the phonological grammar. In contrast to such models, this paper suggests that the difference between the innovative dialect and standard dialects without leveling does not rely on their phonology, but rather in the choice of a morphological exponent.",

One functional sequence, which I label ‘Arabic Fseq’, accommodates the adjective classes of Quality, Size and native Arabic Colour. The other functional sequence, the ‘Greek Fseq’, is where the classes of Shape, Nationality and borrowed Greek Colour adjectives are merged. The two Fseqs differ morphologically, but also syntactically. In the first one we find adjectives with nonconcatenative morphology and obligatory NP-movement, while in the second Fseq we encounter concatenative morphology and optional NP-movement. Cypriot Maronite Arabic adjectives appear, at first blush, to violate what is considered to be the universal adjective order, however, I will show that each of the two Fseqs adheres to the universal order and that that the apparent violation is the result of embedding the Greek Fseq inside the Arabic Fseq",

After a careful examination of the data, it is argued that Romance (Spanish, French and Catalan) ditransitive constructions instantiate DOC, whether they bear clitic doubling or not. Pronominalization facts in Catalan will support this analysis. Finally, a connection between this new view on Romance ditransitive constructions and some dative/accusative alternations in the area is presented.",

I then discuss how this segment’s encompassing vocalic elements might make the phonological behavior of the sound clearer.

Both rules are factually wrong and have to be dismissed. With no rules left, nothing can be ordered. I conclude that Kiparsky’s example submits no evidence in favour of Bromberger and Halle’s claim. There is no reason to assume that phonology and syntax should be fundamentally different.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents two experimentally confirmed observations about contrastive topics (CTs) in German: subparts of CTs can appear in the left periphery, and if a wide contrastive topic contains both a direct object and a directional PP, then only fronting of the DP is compatible with a wide VP contrast interpretation. These observations are reminiscent of the data presented by Fanselow & Lenertov´a (2011) about subparts of focus, who use them to argue against cartographic approaches that predict a one to one relation between fronted phrases and IS categories. My claim is that the CT data basically support this argument against cartographic approaches, but that it can not be subsumed under Fanselow & Lenertov´a’s analysis for sub-part of focus fronting, because their model predicts that movement of contrastively accented elements should be less restricted than it is in the data. A potential independent reason for this restriction is explored, suggesting that the unrestricted movement of subparts of CTs predicted by Fanselow & Lenertov´a can after all be observed under the right pragmatic circumstances.",

I argue that the hodiernal is not a separate reading of the PrP, but a subcase of the existential perfect. The crucial difference between the Catalan and English PrP is not that the former has an extra reading, but rather that it allows for the presence of time adverbials which fix the eventuality on the time axis.",

However, it is also possible that two competing rules do not involve the same initial node in a syntactic tree, but merely make a similar functional contribution. For such cases, it is possible to find diachronic variation with three variants - two for each separate rule and one for the two rules combined. It is argued that a necessary condition for the existence of overlapping forms is rule independence, i.e. the absence of conditioning factors. Old English relative clauses are analysed as an instance of grammar competition with three variants to substantiate this claim.",

At the center of the investigation is the observation that ET and RT can be temporally disjoint. It is further argued that the temporal relation between ET and RT is subject to restrictions that reveal how ET and RT depend on each other. Finally, I compare different ways of analyzing DP-internal temporality.",

The second hypothesis is that DemPros show a stronger preference towards the last-mentioned referent than DPros. We conducted an experiment combining offline- and online-measurements. Our results suggest that perspective plays a role in pronoun resolution and that prominence gives rise to more nuanced preferences among several antecedents.",

However, certain triggers and predicates have been overlooked. To address this research gap, an experiment was conducted in this study to test the projection behavior of such triggers. The results indicate that variability exists in all triggers and call for further investigation into the contextual factors influencing projection behavior.",

Supporting our claim with quantitative data from a 5-point Likert scale acceptability judgement task, we argue that this pattern escapes principled explanations in prominent theories of adjective ordering and highlights the role of Concord in licensing structural configurations.",

I investigate the restrictions on the syntactic position of the standard of comparison (SoC) in Russian phrasal comparatives and show that the existing analyses of this type of comparatives (Pancheva 2006; Philippova 2017) are not satisfactory. The proposed alternative is the direct analysis, which denies the phrasal comparative any clausal source. This claim is supported by patterns of behaviour such as the uniform case marking of the SoC and its mandatory nominal status, which the Russian phrasal comparative shares with other comparative constructions that have been argued to be genuinely phrasal (Bhatt & Takahashi 2007, 2011; Vaikšnoraitė 2021; Potsdam 2017), as well as by the interaction between scrambling and the SoC's available position, which is handled well by the direct analysis.",

    "abstract": "Recently, gender sensitive alternatives towards the use of masculine generics have become an issue of public discourse in Germany. Past research on the topic has shown how the topic is weaponised by political actors on the far right. This study contributes to this understanding by examining the discourse surrounding gender sensitive language on Twitter. A total of 10,000 tweets were extracted and analysed through keyness analysis. The results indicate that opinions on Twitter, as well as the language used within the tweets, reflect how the topic is being weaponised by the far-right.",

I have attempted to analyze these issues using Optimality Theory. Checking the learnability of the proposed grammar, I show that it is possible to learn the grammar but the ranking differs when the model is examined using the Recursive Constraint Demotion and Maximum Entropy Grammar.",

The puzzle is the absence of the subject in the second conjunct which cannot be c-commanded by the subject in the first conjunct. Therefore, a scope relationship cannot be established. I present novel data which show that Samoan subject sharing constructions structurally differ from clausal coordination in that they involve coordination at FP-level (Collins 2017) rather than at the clausal level. I propose that a promising approach are deletion-based accounts and that an exclusively syntactic analysis cannot derive the construction's properties.",

This paper aims to capture the parametric variation of lexical V-V compounds in terms of the labeling theory proposed by Chomsky (2013, 2015). Focusing on the structure formed by two heads {H1, H2}, I argue that while lexical V-V compounds are not allowed in languages like English due to labeling failure, Japanese verbal property can avoid labeling conflict. Furthermore, some syntactic and morphological criteria of Japanese lexical V-V compounds are deduced from the labeling mechanism.",

The analysis is based on the assumption that adjectives in this language can absorb DP-external case and block case assignment on the following noun. To preempt this restriction, the noun must move across the adjective. Crucially though, if the noun's case is assigned in-situ by a DP-internal head, it becomes inactive for movement. I also introduce a new analysis of adjectival agreement in Standard Arabic which can account for full agreement on postnominal adjectives and the absence of agreement on prenominal ones. It also accounts for the unexpected pattern of agreement on adjectives that appear in between two nouns. The new analysis adopts the Upward Agree mechanism proposed in Zeijlstra (2012) and Bjorkman & Zeijlstra (2019).",

According to Fortmann (2018), VDs can be converted into interrogative sentences, which have modal interpretations and are called verbless interrogatives (VIS) in this paper. However, VIs are well-formed only when theme arguments are not coreferential with the speaker. I argue that VDs whose theme arguments are identical to the hearer lack high Mod (cf. Hacquard 2006) and cannot be converted into VIs because they do not retain elements expressing directive meaning.",

The adjectival modifiers da ‘big' and xiao 'small' can be used as phrase-internal modifiers by preceding a classifier in an NCC. However, the two modifiers trigger different modifying patterns. Specifically, when they precede a sortal classifier (SCL), the adjectives modify the sequence SCL+Noun, but when they are placed before a mensural classifier (MCL), the modifiee is the MCL without the noun. Facing the variation in the modifying scope, I assume that both da 'big' and xiao 'big' are modifiers of roots. They can modify a root projection, or they can modify an nP, and their position at the root level determines their modifying scope in the surface structure.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the distribution of wh-elements across different constructions. In particular, it attempts to develop an account for the observation that wh-elements do not distribute freely across different syntactic environments; rather, their distribution is paradigmatic or construction-specific. Such distribution raises issues for current minimalist frameworks, as wh-elements are expected to undergo Merge irrespective of the particular construction being derived. The proposed account captures the relevant distribution by means of language-specific lexical properties of wh-elements in accord with a licensing mechanism operating at the Sensory-Motor interface. This paper moreover discusses the licensing of wh- elements in the contexts of interrogative, free and headed relative constructions.",

Most previous literature has adopted Huang’s (1991) modular approach to explain the various subtypes of A-not-A questions either through reduplication or Anaphoric Ellipsis. However, Huang’s approaches leave unexplained a set of theoretical issues, e.g., the nature of negation in A-not-A questions. Building on Huang (1991), I argue for a unified analysis of the different A-not-A variants, i.e., the syntax of A-not-A questions is an asyndetic coordination (no coordinators between conjuncts), and the different A-not-A variants are derived from either backward deletion or forward ellipsis.",

This paper argues that this property poses a nontrivial problem for all contemporary theories of person-animacy restrictions in minimalist syntax: specifically it yields a paradox, the Inertness Paradox, based on two assumptions shared by almost all contemporary approaches. This can be resolved on the basis of two innovations: (i) the claim that the feature [SPECIFIC] in Chamorro is underspecified on 1st-person; and (ii) a new theory of PARs, which combines Coon & Keine’s (2021) feature gluttony model with Deal’s (2024) dynamic interaction architecture.",

The analysis of speech and written corpora (KIParla and CORIS respectively) reveals diaphasic and diamesic variations. Formal written Italian shows higher percentage of use of aspectual values, while the periphrastic constructions seem to be used to a lower degree in spontaneous speech. Additionally, corpora investigation indicates that the inchoative-imminential aspect is more frequent in speech than in written texts.",

In parallel, rule-based models of phonology, chiefly Search-and-Copy, suggest that the phonological component adheres to the same Minimalist principles as syntax. This paper examines the similarities between these Search algorithms to propose a unified, domain-neutral Minimal Search, leveraging the similarities in representation and computation across both domains. Additionally, it suggests the application of this domain-neutral Search in spreading domains, which are extended from non-manual markers to account for cases of morphosyntactic concord and phonological iterativity.",

Building on Bryant et al. (2023), I propose that tough-adjectives can select a defective Voice head (VoiceR), unable to assign accusative and introducing an external argument as an unvalued feature (cf. long passives). Furthermore, I show that VoiceR is only available in extremely reduced verbal complements, as it must be directly selected by the embedding predicate.",

The two phenomena are reported to appear and disappear together; universal quantifiers (UQs) like every/all can remove both (Kriˇz 2015). The nature of Mandarin UQs has long been contested since they canonically co-occur with dou, which also seems to also exert UQ force. In this paper, I will present novel data that dou has the true UQ power due to its ability to remove homogeneity. Building on the view that homogeneity results from pluralization (since Schwarzschild 1993), I treat dou as a universal pluralization operator ∀-PL (Bar-Lev 2021); homogeneity removal is thus a by-product of agreement between UQ and ∀-PL.",

    "abstract": "This paper reports on an experimental study of principle C reconstruction in German ATBmovement. The results indicate that the previously reported asymmetry between the two conjuncts is due to distance between the referent and the pronoun. The findings suggest that principle C reconstruction is not suitable to probe into underlying syntactic structures, while prompting a discussion about experimental designs for coreference tasks. I hypothesize that binding phenomena in ATB-dependencies show different patterns due to their own nature, not some inherent trait of ATB-movement.",

In addition to inverse marking, morphological movement and movement-related repair operations can derive exponent drop, i.e. the unexpected absence of certain exponents whenever they realise the less salient argument.",

This structure ensures that objects in an SVC always c-command those they linearly precede, accounting for quantificational binding between objects of different verbs. However, a case study on Malayalam suggests that languages replicating these facts may be incompatible with her proposal. An alternative structure and reanalysis of the binding data are provided.",

Through empirical analysis, it demonstrates that NC operates beyond typical locality constraints such as the Phase Impenetrability Condition (PIC) and Condition on Extraction Domains (CED) and instead conforms to the finite CP boundary. This constraint applies uniformly to both licensing and movement, implying that no NC items can cross finite CP boundaries. By adopting a downward AGREE framework, this study provides a clearer understanding of NC, highlighting its distinct syntactic behaviour and reinforcing the significance of the CP boundary in WS languages.",

By and large, the majority of the analyses presented to account for the facts of Case assignment in this variety draw on the notion of agreement between functional heads and nominal arguments. Upon closer examination, however, it turns out that these agreement-based accounts are under-determined by empirical data. To remediate this problem, this paper argues that dependent Case theory provides a more satisfactory alternative to tackle this issue.",

Since DurAds are standardly assumed to diagnose atelicity, such examples constitute the main argument for separating Slavic perfectivity from telicity (e.g. Borik 2006), and pose the major obstacle for the view that perfectives in Slavic are telic (e.g. Łazorczyk 2010). I propose that DurAds are generated in the QP (a telicity projection), while podel combines with the QP, specifiying a telic predicate for singularity. Consequently, all prefixed perfective verbs in Slavic are necessarily telic.",

So, present-under-past temporal de se is preferred over past-under-past temporal de re to get simultaneous readings. Finally, interspeaker variation is predicted for SOT languages and a new diagnostic for temporal de re in SOT languages is developed.",

The intensification effects of this clitic emerge pragmatically, due to Levinson’s (2000) M-principle. The paper provides evidence for TSs as legitimate syntactic objects (Kratzer 2007/2021), supporting the view that there are no ‘dummy’ pronouns (e.g. Langacker 2011).",

MMCs have been argued by Tsunoda (2020) to be monoclausal, but data from Kazym Khanty suggests otherwise: Khanty MMCs are biclausal and exhibit control. Based on arguments involving clausal negation, passivisation of the embedded clause, scope of negative pronouns and partial control, I demonstrate that MMCs can be biclausal, thus potentially expanding Tsunoda’s classificaton of mermaid constructions.",

While analyzing wh-exclamatives in languages like Catalan (Miro´ 2006) and English (Rett 2008a, 2011), it has been established that they bear a degree denoting property in the domain, which caters to the surprising element of the clause. However, there is opposing cross-linguistic evidence. Languages like Turkish, Dutch, Russian, Hungarian (Nouwen & Chernilovskaya 2015); Telugu, Kannada (Balusu 2019) show a wide variety in their wh-exclamatives and cannot be analyzed along the lines of Miro´ (2006); Rett (2008a, 2011). Bangla is no exception. This paper provides a unified compositional analysis for wh-exclamatives in Bangla.",

    "abstract": "The nominal structure proposed in Ritter & Wiltschko (2021), Wiltschko (2021) and McDonald et al. (in prep) divides languages with honorificity into two types – type I languages that recycle their phi-features to encode honorificity and type II languages that lack phi-features and instead have dedicated (non)-honorific pronouns, called paranouns. This paper claims that this typology is not exhaustive and adds a third type considering the honorificity pattern in Maithili, an Eastern Indo-Aryan language. I propose that this third type of language encodes honorificity inside the DP layer, as opposed to the other two types that encode it outside the DP. I also show that other languages in the Indo-Aryan family show the same pattern, at least partially, as Maithili.",

The main hypothesis was according to Bisle-Müller (1991) and Ahrenholz (2007) that dieser is able to express contrast and therefore should be preferred in the contrastive cases. However, the results do not support the hypothesis. Instead, they are in line with Bosch & Hinterwimmer (2016), who claim that der can express a contrast as well.",

Based on the ideas of phases by Chomsky (2008) and Kanno (2008), among others, I argue that the difference of islandhood in Chinese and English can be explained by arguing that phases are not formed in Chinese because it lacks phi feature agreement. Furthermore, I extend the analysis to long-distance binding in Chinese, following the analysis of Quicoli (2008) and Saito (2017a, b). If my proposal is correct, it suggests that languages which lack phi feature agreement do not show a phase effect entirely.",

When a ONE-phrase is structurally lower, it can take the maximal scope through existential quantification. The scope relations between IO and DO reveals that IO is structurally higher than DO in HKSL. This study provides insights in adopting scope relations to investigate structural hierarchy in sign languages.",

Instead, we propose two different models integrating the Mirror Principle among other morphological and syntactic constraints: an approach based on a stratal application of the Optimality Theory, and an approach using a set of morphosyntactic operations, ruled by a ‘specificity’ principle.",

Using a small-scale corpus study, I examine how the presence of homophones after truncation influences the rate of TD Deletion for monomorphemes.

    "abstract": "In this paper, I provide a first look at the phonology of loanwords in Trio, a Cariban language spoken in Suriname and Brazil. Because of Trio’s restrictive phonotactics, many loanwords are adapted through vowel epenthesis and consonant deletion. Using data from Meira (1999), Meira & Muysken (2017) and Carlin (2017), I compiled a corpus of 114 loanwords in Trio, from various source languages such as Dutch, Portuguese and Sranan. Analysis of this corpus shows that different strategies for vowel epenthesis are used systematically, and that there is a surprisingly high rate of consonant deletion which is as of yet unexplained.",

This study focuses on a distributional difference that provides evidence for assigning different semantics to POSS-ing and ACC-ing: while both with and without can select ACC-ing as their complement, POSS-ing is only compatible with without. I present a semantic and pragmatic interpretation for the structure 'without' + POSS-ing, and then discuss two explanations for the distributional asymmetry based on the assumption that POSS-ing, but not ACC-ing, should be familiar in the discourse.",

Experimental studies support this syntactico-semantic distinction, albeit not categorically; additional factors play a role in word order preferences, e.g., information structure. I explore the roles of verb type and adjunct placement on word order preferences in a judgment task administered to heritage, L2, and native Spanish speakers. Results suggest all groups are sensitive to these effects: speakers show a preference for preverbal subjects with unergative verbs and a tendency to accept postverbal subjects with preverbal adverbs.",

Assuming that directionality diagnostics can be used to provide evidence in favor either of derivational theories (Marchand 1963a, 1964; Kiparsky 1982) or of underspecification accounts (Farrell 2001; Borer 2013), a self-collected data set of 60 German verb-noun pairs is investigated on the basis of five diagnostics. The results indicate that most zero-nominals are zero-derived from verbal bases, which largely supports a directional derivational analysis. A non-directional analysis is motivated for those word pairs where no derivational direction can be identified",

Based on phonetic and functional parameters we explore the question whether these instances can be attributed to one of the lexemes <ja> or <naja>. While phonetic measurements yield ambivalent results, analyses regarding pragmatic parameters such as function and turn position indicate that realisations of [nja] in most cases were intended as <ja>. Nevertheless, some functional differences between <ja> and [nja] can be observed.",

Due to their syntactic productivity and internal complexity, work stemming from Longobardi (1994) has assumed that proper names are created in the syntax via N◦ -to-D◦ movement. However, these approaches leave unexplained a set of semantic and syntactic asymmetries between common and proper names. Our paper will highlight three: the DP Divergence Point, the Semantic Exocentricity of Proper DPs, and the Featural Inaccessibility of Proper DPs. Building on Longobardi (1994) and the split DP hypothesis (Aboh 2004; Haegeman 2004 et seq.), we suggest that proper names require intermediate movement to a lower projection: DeixP. N◦ -to-Deix◦ movement renders the NP as a whole an indexical.",

The aspectual ambiguity of DNs follows from the absence of the category-defining head v, which blocks telicity/quantity. To derive this result, I develop an analysis of Polish verb stems within Distributed Morphology (DM), involving fusion, the ¬ specification (Siddiqi 2009) and PF crashing",

Even though their analysis seems successful, I point out a hitherto unacknowledged fact that embedding a cleft wh-question degrades a sentence, which is hard to explain with their analysis if it is taken at its face value. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to elaborate on their analysis: I claim that the two focus-related features, [±exhaustivity] and [±sharing-presupposition], induce the focus movement in clefts. The paper further discusses ReportP-size clauses (e.g., Saito 2010) based on my proposal.",

However, free choice disjunction defies this simple fact: when a disjunction acts as a free choice operator, all options are true. The usage of free choice disjunction is observed to usually co-occur with modals, pluralities, etc. This paper introduces a novel observation of sentences with free choice disjunction in English. Multiple data points are presented to demonstrate the semantic distribution. I propose that free choice reading in disjunctions depends on three factors: the sentence’s genericity, scope of the disjunction and disjuncts being imperfect nominals.",

I also discuss other (mostly morphological) differences dependent on the interpretation of 'moč' and argue that they all are in line with the assumption that 'moč' may occupy different positions in the clausal spine. While root 'moč' is either a lexical verb or low Modabil/perm head, epistemic 'moč' resides in the high Modepist head.",

Various contexts in which this nominal suffix occurs are identified, including negation, polar questions, universal quantification, adverbials, the object of comparison, and locatives. I characterise these as non-specific contexts and frame-setting topics. I compare these contexts to those in which the augment (nominal pre-prefix) is dropped in Bantu languages and, based on the empirical similarities, I discuss whether analyses of the Bantu augment can account for the Gorwaa cases. One analysis proposes that the suffix marks (non-)specificity, which I show is not fully satisfactory. Instead, I propose that what truly conditions the appearance of the suffix is the syntactic position of the nominal with respect to the verb phrase.",

I claim that this asymmetry can be solved with recourse to prosodic phonology (Nespor & Vogel 1986/2007), by assuming that stems and suffixes form a prosodic unit where Mid tones fuse to avoid OCP-Mid. But OCP-Mid also triggers dissimilation across the prefix–stem environment due to prosodic boundaries. This is an example of phonological conspiracy (Kisseberth 2011).",

Data points towards an analysis in which each combination of nonmanuals conveys a different bias and a novel feature-based description system would explain and predict that.

I argue for three separate but interrelated claims: (i) Georgian exhibits genuine, structurally constrained root suppletion, supporting a late insertion view contra Borer (2014); (ii) Bobaljik & Harley (2017)’s generalization that all intransitive verbs which supplete for number are unaccusatives can be upheld; (iii) a unified analysis for root suppletion and the preverb da- is possible.",

I argue that the antecedent of a parasitic gap construction first fissions into two independent parts—thereby allowing it to occupy two different base positions—and is then fused again into one item which occupies the surface position. I further show that this analysis makes the correct predictions concerning the properties of parasitic gaps, setting it apart from previous approaches, which all had to struggle with capturing the behavior of parasitic gaps. In particular, I will present solutions to the following questions: (i) why are parasitic gaps only selectively sensitive to islands? (ii) Why do the real and the parasitic gap exhibit different properties concerning reconstruction and extractability from weak islands? (iii) Why can parasitic gaps only be licensed by Ā-movement but not by A-movement?",

I suggest a route to an analysis that is not construction-specific but reflects independent properties of the grammar such as phases (syntax), information structure and the postsyntactic realization of inherent case as prepositions (PF). In combination these aspects yield a more natural picture and a better understanding of certain features of this construction than do analyses which rely on syntax alone.",

  "abstract": "In colloquial Dutch the higher and the lower clause of long-distance relative clauses (RCs) can both be introduced by a relative pronoun. I argue that these doubling data are most easily compatible with a (specific implementation of the) head external analysis (HEA) of RCs. I show that although head internal analyses (HIAs) of RCs have gained a lot of ground in recent years, they face a variety of problems that are not encountered by a HEA. I furthermore show that the most prominent argument in favor of HIAs – namely the presence of reconstruction effects – is not very well founded, as reconstruction without movement or copies seems to be needed anyway. This strongly suggests that reconstruction is not a full proof diagnostic for movement, and that the presence or absence of reconstruction effects in RCs thus provides inconclusive evidence to support any analysis of RCs.",

Some wh-dependencies were D(iscourse)-linked (i.e. involved a lexically-specified wh-phrase like which horse) and others involved a non D-linked wh-phrase like who. Both kinds of wh-phrase show evidence of being represented at available intermediate positions within the long-distance dependencies. It is argued that this is inconsistent with Pesetsky (1987) whose hypothesis claimed that D-linked dependencies are formed via binding, and as such are predicted to be able to bypass intermediate reactivations. At points in the time-course where the potential for the violation of dependency-formation constraints becomes apparent, a D-linked antecedent seems to benefit the parse. This motivated the idea that the reduction in constraint-sensitivity which D-linking seems to elicit could be the result of time-locked “stabiliser” effects during moments of complex processing. Finally, the data may indicate a behavioural difference between intermediate and verbal antecedent reactivation during processing.",

First, some background about the language is given, including its inventory of personal pronouns. Next, the cluster-internal and -external ordering are reported, and the four combination types are divided into whether or not there are two overt pronominal forms in the clitic cluster. An Optimality-theoretic analysis is then proposed.",

The algorithm is based on the traditional framework of progressive multiple sequence alignment (cf.

Dolgopolsky 1986, Turchin et al. 2010) accompanied by specific scoring functions, (2) the modification of gap scores based on prosodic context, (3) a new method for the detection of swapped sites in already aligned sequences. The algorithm is implemented as part of the LingPy library (http://lingulist.de/lingpy), a suite of open source Python modules for various tasks in quantitative historical linguistics. The method was tested on a benchmark dataset of 152 manually edited multiple alignments covering data for 192 Bulgarian dialects (Prokić et al. 2009). The results show that the new method yields alignments which differ only in 5 % of all sequences from the gold standard.",

Instead, I show that split topics involve two autonomously generated noun phrases that are predicatively related. This predication is syntactically unstable, however: Merge of two XPs within a single argument or adjunct position yields a structure for which no label (‘head’) can be detected by Minimal Search (‘for any {α, β}, α is the head if α is a lexical item’). Therefore, one of the two noun phrases has to move, yielding the ‘split’ in overt form. By providing a principled explanation for the split topicalization in German (and most likely other languages) in these terms, the analysis furnishes empirical evidence for an architecture in which Merge operates freely, and as an asymmetricizing device when applying internally.",

The RC is argued to have a Raising structure and to be merged in situ, contra extraposing it from subject position.

They can be interpreted as central adverbials modifying the event structure, or as peripheral adverbials, modifying the discourse structure.

  "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss theme vowels in Modern Hebrew and Italian. These vowels reveal a morphological phenomenon that cannot be attributed to the specific root or to the category-assigning head. In Modern Hebrew, theme vowels are positioned between the last two radicals, whereas in Italian they are suffixed to the root. We claim that both languages have an intermediate level which introduces these theme vowels. The difference in position follows from the non-syllabified status of Modern Hebrew roots at insertion. We further show that both languages exhibit direct merger of n and the root.",

  "abstract": "In languages with global case splits (GCS), an overt case marker shows up on one of the arguments of a transitive verb if the internal argument is higher on a Silverstein hierarchy than the external argument. Thus, it seems that case assignment in vP either requires look-ahead or has to apply counter-cyclically. In this paper, I present a strictly local analysis of GCS in a derivational framework. To this end, I depart from the traditional assumption that case depends on the φ-features of both arguments of a transitive verb in GCS languages. Furthermore, I show that the approach can also be extended to capture Local Case Splits, non-split case systems as well as direct-inverse marking. Besides, Burzio’s Generalization falls out as a byproduct of the analysis.",

  "abstract": "In this paper I propose a unified account for both local and global case splits in terms of local impoverishment. My main claim is that impoverishment takes place within narrow syntax and may thus interact with the operation Agree. This reassessment of the place of impoverishment in the grammar has the immediate consequence that Agree may apply after impoverishment. Such ‘late’ Agree may then percolate the effects of local impoverishment within the structure, giving rise to the impression of non-local mechanisms at work. A second, logically independent, claim is that impoverishment is brought about by harmonic alignment of Silverstein hierarchies. The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 lays the empirical groundwork by exemplifying local and global case splits and showing that they adhere to the same generalization. Section 2 introduces the theoretical background assumptions and puts forth my proposal. Sections 3 and 4 put the account to work on local and global splits, respectively. Section 5 illustrates an empirical prediction of the proposed system regarding the interaction of local and global splits with verbal agreement. Finally, section 6 draws the conclusion.",

Syntactically, the internal copy of a relative clause head licenses constructions that I show can only be licensed by a full DP: movement out of weak islands and parasitic gapping. Semantically, relative clause heads hosting ACD sites show scopal sensitivity to elements inside the relative clause, which requires an analysis with a full copy of the DP head originating inside the relative clause. Based on both theoretical considerations of licensing ellipsis and empirical diagnostics, I argue that relative clauses require a modified matching analysis, such that a full copy of the DP hosting the relative clause originates inside the relative clause itself, with second copy of the DP in the matrix clause.",

I claim that NI and its non-NI counterpart have quite different structures: in NI, a root merging with the light verb su ‘do’ constitutes a verb as a whole, whereas in non-NI, a root first merges with an n and then the root-n complex is combined with the light verb. This structural difference brings about quite interesting consequences both from syntactic and phonological point of views.",

Interestingly, the distinction cannot be caused by different result-state clauses (PPs vs. APs) but is due to the semantic category of the verb.

  "abstract": "Since the mid-1970’s it is well known that tone in many languages behaves independently from its tone bearing unit, and conspiracy arguments lead to consider tone as a distinct item. However, tone is commonly sensitive to some specific segments, and is sometimes involved in a specific relationship with its bearing units. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid so far to the fact that, in some languages, tone has a direct effect on the vowel to which it is associated. In this article, it is demonstrated that a tone may prevent the deletion or the gliding of a vowel resulting from hiatus situations. This assertion is supported by a detailed analysis of similar phenomena in the Bantu language Shingazidja. In a first attempt of an OT analysis, it is proposed that the absence of gliding may result from the high ranking of a constraint V´-μ,, which says that a tone bearing unit has to be moraic.",

  "abstract": "This paper provides an analysis of the so-called C(ognate) O(bject) C(onstruction) (eg. He sighed a weary sigh) on the basis of a syntactic theory of lexical decomposition. I examine the main properties of this construction and the differences it shows with respect to another one that has been related in the literature and that I will call the H(yponymic) O(bject) C(onstruction). Once these two structures are analyzed independently, we observe a difference between English and Romance with respect to their distribution. Finally, the paper is devoted to analyzing the cross-linguistic distribution of COs and to their co-relations with other unselected objects.",

  "abstract": "German features a variety of evidential strategies, i.e. ways to express the speaker’s type of source of information for a proposition. The evidential (reportative) uses of the German modal verbs sollen ‘should’ and wollen ‘want’ are typically given a purely modal analysis that yields correct predictions for unembedded cases, but fails to account for many embedded occurrences. Based on a corpus and a questionnaire study it is argued that these modals can receive three distinct kinds of interpretation when they occur embedded in clausal complements (partly dependent on the embedding predicate). A revised analysis of reportative sollen is offered that involves a reportative presupposition and a conditionally activated assertive component. Finally, sollen is compared to other reportative strategies in German, especially the reportative subjunctive, and the effects of having multiple evidentials in a single clause are pointed out (evidential concord).",

  "abstract": "Noun-Verb Incorporation (NVI) is optional with some nominals but obligatory with others in Japanese. In this paper, I argue that the obligatory or optional nature of NVI comes from a structural difference between nominals. I claim that one type of nominal can be realized either as a DP or an nP, and that the other type of nominal can only be realized as an nP, assuming that the structural realization is closely tied to the argument structure of the nominals. Based on this, I provide an explanation where an nP option yields an incorporated form via the operation MOVE, while a DP option provides an unincorporated form via the operation AGREE.",

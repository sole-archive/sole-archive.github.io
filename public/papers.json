    "abstract": "This paper is an investigation into the temporal relations we find inside simple DPs. Specifically, I explore the relationship between two DP-internal times: the evaluation time (ET) of the noun and the resource time (RT), which is the time that contributes to the implicit domain restriction. At the center of the investigation is the observation that ET and RT can be temporally disjoint. It is further argued that the temporal relation between ET and RT is subject to restrictions that reveal how ET and RT depend on each other. Finally, I compare different ways of analyzing DP-internal temporality.",

In this paper, I have looked into the attitudes towards, and use of, gender-neutral pronouns in Norwegian. I also explored how speakers of Norwegian feel about the insertion of a gender-neutral pronoun in the language. In this paper, I discuss my findings, which had a great diversity, though there were more positive attitudes than expected. Speakers of Norwegian were generally accepting of the insertion of hen ‘they (singular)’ and thought it would have a positive effect on our society.",

We investigated the hypothesis that DPros can refer to a discourse referent that is information structurally prominent when the speaker is available as perspectivetaker while DemPros are not sensitive to perspective taking. The second hypothesis is that DemPros show a stronger preference towards the last-mentioned referent than DPros. We conducted an experiment combining offline- and online-measurements. Our results suggest that perspective plays a role in pronoun resolution and that prominence gives rise to more nuanced preferences among several antecedents.",

Some experiments examine a broader range of triggers, highlighting the variability in presupposition projection (e.g., Smith & Hall 2011; Tonhauser et al. 2018; Xue & Onea 2011), while others focus on clause-embedding predicates to differentiate factive from non-factive predicates based on their projection behavior (e.g., De Marneffe et al. 2019; Degen & Tonhauser 2022). However, certain triggers and predicates have been overlooked. To address this research gap, an experiment was conducted in this study to test the projection behavior of such triggers. The results indicate that variability exists in all triggers and call for further investigation into the contextual factors influencing projection behavior.",

We claim that, keeping the semantic interpretation constant, the ability to inflect determines whether an adjective can appear prenominally, with non-inflecting adjectives confined to the postnominal position. Supporting our claim with quantitative data from a 5-point Likert scale acceptability judgement task, we argue that this pattern escapes principled explanations in prominent theories of adjective ordering and highlights the role of Concord in licensing structural configurations.",

The study contributes to the typology of attitude verb alternations and proposes that generalizations like the Implicational Complementation Hierarchy can be used to constrain allosemy rules.",

Based on new data, the study argues for a deletion-based account and challenges syntactic-only explanations, highlighting the interaction between coordination, word order, and case marking in a verb-initial, ergative language.",

Most previous literature has adopted Huang’s (1991) modular approach to explain the various subtypes of A-not-A questions either through reduplication or Anaphoric Ellipsis. However, Huang’s approaches leave unexplained a set of theoretical issues, e.g., the nature of negation in A-not-A questions. Building on Huang (1991), I argue for a unified analysis of the different A-not-A variants, i.e., the syntax of A-not-A questions is an asyndetic coordination (no coordinators between conjuncts), and the different A-not-A variants are derived from either backward deletion or forward ellipsis.",

This paper argues that this property poses a nontrivial problem for all contemporary theories of person-animacy restrictions in minimalist syntax: specifically it yields a paradox, the Inertness Paradox, based on two assumptions shared by almost all contemporary approaches. This can be resolved on the basis of two innovations: (i) the claim that the feature [SPECIFIC] in Chamorro is underspecified on 1st-person; and (ii) a new theory of PARs, which combines Coon & Keine’s (2021) feature gluttony model with Deal’s (2024) dynamic interaction architecture.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the grammaticalization of Italian motion verbs (andare ‘to go’, venire ‘to come’, tornare ‘to come back’) in the “motion verb + a + infinitive” construction, focusing on their aspectual meanings (culminative, inchoative-imminential, iterative). The analysis of speech and written corpora (KIParla and CORIS respectively) reveals diaphasic and diamesic variations. Formal written Italian shows higher percentage of use of aspectual values, while the periphrastic constructions seem to be used to a lower degree in spontaneous speech. Additionally, corpora investigation indicates that the inchoative-imminential aspect is more frequent in speech than in written texts.",

    "abstract": "Developments in Minimalist syntax have explored the extent to which core operations of the syntactic component can be unified through a Minimal Search algorithm. In parallel, rule-based models of phonology, chiefly Search-and-Copy, suggest that the phonological component adheres to the same Minimalist principles as syntax. This paper examines the similarities between these Search algorithms to propose a unified, domain-neutral Minimal Search, leveraging the similarities in representation and computation across both domains. Additionally, it suggests the application of this domain-neutral Search in spreading domains, which are extended from non-manual markers to account for cases of morphosyntactic concord and phonological iterativity.",

In examining the morphosyntactic implications of this hypothesis, I further argue that a single que exists that can realise different portions of the same underlying structure, based on a spanning-like derivation a la ` Svenonius (2012; 2016; 2020).",

Building on Bryant et al. (2023), I propose that tough-adjectives can select a defective Voice head (VoiceR), unable to assign accusative and introducing an external argument as an unvalued feature (cf. long passives). Furthermore, I show that VoiceR is only available in extremely reduced verbal complements, as it must be directly selected by the embedding predicate.",

The two phenomena are reported to appear and disappear together; universal quantifiers (UQs) like every/all can remove both (Kriˇz 2015). The nature of Mandarin UQs has long been contested since they canonically co-occur with dou, which also seems to also exert UQ force. In this paper, I will present novel data that dou has the true UQ power due to its ability to remove homogeneity. Building on the view that homogeneity results from pluralization (since Schwarzschild 1993), I treat dou as a universal pluralization operator ∀-PL (Bar-Lev 2021); homogeneity removal is thus a by-product of agreement between UQ and ∀-PL.",

In addition to inverse marking, morphological movement and movement-related repair operations can derive exponent drop, i.e. the unexpected absence of certain exponents whenever they realise the less salient argument.",

This structure ensures that objects in an SVC always c-command those they linearly precede, accounting for quantificational binding between objects of different verbs. However, a case study on Malayalam suggests that languages replicating these facts may be incompatible with her proposal. An alternative structure and reanalysis of the binding data are provided.",

Through empirical analysis, it demonstrates that NC operates beyond typical locality constraints such as the Phase Impenetrability Condition (PIC) and Condition on Extraction Domains (CED) and instead conforms to the finite CP boundary. This constraint applies uniformly to both licensing and movement, implying that no NC items can cross finite CP boundaries. By adopting a downward AGREE framework, this study provides a clearer understanding of NC, highlighting its distinct syntactic behaviour and reinforcing the significance of the CP boundary in WS languages.",

By and large, the majority of the analyses presented to account for the facts of Case assignment in this variety draw on the notion of agreement between functional heads and nominal arguments. Upon closer examination, however, it turns out that these agreement-based accounts are under-determined by empirical data. To remediate this problem, this paper argues that dependent Case theory provides a more satisfactory alternative to tackle this issue.",

Since DurAds are standardly assumed to diagnose atelicity, such examples constitute the main argument for separating Slavic perfectivity from telicity (e.g. Borik 2006), and pose the major obstacle for the view that perfectives in Slavic are telic (e.g. Łazorczyk 2010).

Indeed, only some of them get temporal de re readings of the embedded past. An analysis in terms of an individually parametrized Prefer Local Binding rule in the temporal domain is proposed, prioritizing logical forms with locally bound temporal variables. So, present-under-past temporal de se is preferred over past-under-past temporal de re to get simultaneous readings. Finally, interspeaker variation is predicted for SOT languages and a new diagnostic for temporal de re in SOT languages is developed.",

We argue that the IAC ga is referential — it refers to a specific Topic Situation (TS). Specifically, it is base-generated as a Direct Object, marking affectedness of the specific TS. The intensification effects of this clitic emerge pragmatically, due to Levinson’s (2000) M-principle. The paper provides evidence for TSs as legitimate syntactic objects (Kratzer 2007/2021), supporting the view that there are no ‘dummy’ pronouns (e.g. Langacker 2011).",

Mermaid constructions (MMCs) consist of the following parts: [[Clause] Noun Copula] (for a detailed description and criteria, see Tsunoda 2020). MMCs can express modal, aspectual, evidential and other meanings. MMCs have been argued by Tsunoda (2020) to be monoclausal, but data from Kazym Khanty suggests otherwise: Khanty MMCs are biclausal and exhibit control. Based on arguments involving clausal negation, passivisation of the embedded clause, scope of negative pronouns and partial control, I demonstrate that MMCs can be biclausal, thus potentially expanding Tsunoda’s classificaton of mermaid constructions.",

Rett 2008a, 2011), this paper mainly focuses on wh-exclamatives in Bangla (a.k.a. Bengali; Indo-Aryan (IA)). While analyzing wh-exclamatives in languages like Catalan (Miro´ 2006) and English (Rett 2008a, 2011), it has been established that they bear a degree denoting property in the domain, which caters to the surprising element of the clause. However, there is opposing cross-linguistic evidence. Languages like Turkish, Dutch, Russian, Hungarian (Nouwen & Chernilovskaya 2015); Telugu, Kannada (Balusu 2019) show a wide variety in their wh-exclamatives and cannot be analyzed along the lines of Miro´ (2006); Rett (2008a, 2011). Bangla is no exception. This paper provides a unified compositional analysis for wh-exclamatives in Bangla.",

This paper claims that this typology is not exhaustive and adds a third type considering the honorificity pattern in Maithili, an Eastern Indo-Aryan language. I propose that this third type of language encodes honorificity inside the DP layer, as opposed to the other two types that encode it outside the DP. I also show that other languages in the Indo-Aryan family show the same pattern, at least partially, as Maithili.",

However, the results do not support the hypothesis. Instead, they are in line with Bosch & Hinterwimmer (2016), who claim that der can express a contrast as well.",

Furthermore, I extend the analysis to long-distance binding in Chinese, following the analysis of Quicoli (2008) and Saito (2017a, b). If my proposal is correct, it suggests that languages which lack phi feature agreement do not show a phase effect entirely.",

When a ONE-phrase is structurally lower, it can take the maximal scope through existential quantification. The scope relations between IO and DO reveals that IO is structurally higher than DO in HKSL. This study provides insights in adopting scope relations to investigate structural hierarchy in sign languages.",
